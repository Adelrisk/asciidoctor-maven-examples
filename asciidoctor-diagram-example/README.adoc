= Asciidoctor Maven Plugin: Asciidoctor Diagram Example

An example project that demonstrates how to integrate Asciidoctor Diagram with the Asciidoctor Maven plugin.

== Usage

Convert the AsciiDoc to HTML5 by invoking the `process-resources` goal (configured as the default goal):

 $ mvn

Open the file _target/generated-docs/example-manual.html_ in your browser to see the generated HTML file containing the generated diagram images.

[NOTE]
====
Asciidoctor Diagram bundles both the ditaa and PlantUML libraries and will use them to generate diagrams. In order to generate diagrams using Graphviz, you must install it separately (meaning the _dot_ command must be available on your PATH).

Visit link:http://www.graphviz.org/[Graphviz' site] for details on how to install the _dot_ command tool.
